# SocialNetwork_OOP

## Overview

In this project, we developed a social network in Python using three design patterns: singleton, factory, and observer. These design patterns were applied to build a robust and efficient social networking system.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory**: Defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer**: Allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state, maintaining consistency across the system.

## Features

- User management with singleton pattern to ensure unique instance.
- Dynamic object creation using factory pattern.
- Real-time updates and notifications using observer pattern.

    cd OOP_Ex2_T1
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Requirements
